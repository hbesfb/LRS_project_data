# LRS_project_data

This repository was created to provide an overview of the data processed at HUS in relation to the on-going LRS project. The data will be produced by pipeline runs or by stand-alone runs carried out to provide a basis for comparing different tools and combinations of different tools.

It obviously is not feasible to populate the repository with the real data, but I will include scripts and reports as well as information regarding where the entirety of the data can be found on isilon.
